			<h4>Important</h4>

			If you are reporting a problem with the site, please do not just tell us that "the site doesn't work" - as that's not particular helpful :) If you could take a few minutes to answer these specific questions in your message then it's much more likely that we'll be able to address the issue quickly:
			<ul>				
				<li>What exactly were you doing on the site (in detail) before the problem occurred?</li>
				<li>Can you reproduce the problem? i.e., if you reload the site and then try to do the same thing you did before, does the problem happen again?
				<li>What device, operating system, and browser are you using? (include version numbers if you can)</li>
				<li>Had you been working on the site for a while before the problem occurred or had you just recently logged in?</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
