	<h1>Overview</h1>

	<p>
		In a nutshell, the purpose of Studybash is to help students study - as individuals, in groups, and as an entire class. It is completely free (no ads).
	</p>

	<h1>What's the point?</h1>

		Studybash is built around the idea of flashcards (i.e., notes taken in a Q/A format). Although flashcards are traditionally associated with rote memorization of simple vocabularly or definitions, that needn't be the case. Indeed, one might suggest that flashcards are even more useful for helping you to learn complex material. In such cases, the main benefit comes not from being able to test yourself on the material after you've made the flashcards (which is still very useful), but in the process of constructing the flashcards themselves.
	</p>

	<p>
		The studying method of just repeatedly reading over your notes relies heavily on recognition memory: When the material in your notes begins to feel overly famililar to you, you consider it learned and move on to the next section. In contrast to this passive approach of copying down and then re-reading notes from lecture slides and/or a textbook, creating flashcards forces you to actively engage with the material - i.e., examining how concepts relate to one another and thinking about how the lecturer might evaluate your understanding of them. In other words, rather than just writing down content that you expect to maybe be an answer for some type of question in the future, for every piece of content you add to your notes you must now think of a specific question that it would be an answer to. This active engagement with the material (assuming you don't just think up super-lame questions!) should, hopefully, provide a substantially deeper level of memory encoding than simply relying on recognition memory alone.
	</p>

	<p>
		Accordingly, to make full use of Studybash's capabilities, all you need to do is slightly adjust your current note-taking method: Rather than just writing down information that you believe to be important (i.e., potential answers), you will now be making explicit the question that the information would be an answer for. Of course, if you're not sold regarding the whole flashcard routine, Studybash can also be used for traditional-style notes (see the <a href="<%= ROOT %>#help/flashcards/" class="navigate">flashcards</a> help section for more info).

	<h1>How does it work?</h1>

	<p>
		In brief, here's how you would use Studybash for a single class (see the <a href="<%= ROOT %>#help/flashcards/" class="navigate">flashcards</a> help section for more info):
		<ol>
			<li>Add the class that you are taking (e.g., PSYC 101, Fall <%= YEAR %>)</li>
			<li>For that class, create <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="'Set': Collection of one or more flashcards" data-placement="auto top">sets</a> of flashcards (e.g., "Lecture 1", "Lecture 2", etc...)</li>
			<li>Based upon lecture slides, notes taken in class, and your textbook, create a number of flashcards and add them to those sets.</li>
			<li>Test yourself on the flashcards you've added.</li>
			<li>A+s for everyone!<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Yes, this is hyperbole." data-placement="auto top">*</a></li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h1>Tell me more!</h1>

	<p>
		Okay then! Despite its simplicity in concept and design, you can actually do quite a bit with Studybash. Here are some of its key features:
		<ol>
			<li>Convert pages of notes quickly into flashcards, simply by putting <code>{{q}}</code> before each question and <code>{{a}}</code> before each answer in your notes.</li>			
			<li>Tag flashcards as <code>difficult</code>, <code>follow-up</code>, <code>lecture</code>, <code>textbook</code>, etc...</li>
			<li>Filter flashcards by tags and/or keywords, showing only the ones that match.</li>			
			<li>Create tests based upon flashcard filters (e.g., only include cards from "Lecture 1" and "Lecture 4" that are <code>difficult</code>)</li>
			<li>Create and share traditional-style notes - a flashcard with an empty answer field is automatically tagged as a <code>note</code>.</li>
			<li>Share your notes, flashcards, and tests with the whole class or just a private studygroup (or not at all)</li>			
			<li>Easily apply <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/editing-help" class="navigate">Markdown</a> to flashcards to include text formatting (e.g., bullet points) as well as pictures, links, etc...</li>
			<li>Designed to work on mobile, tablets, laptops, and desktops (e.g., using your phone, test yourself while going to/from University on the bus).
		</ol>

	<h1>Okay I'm ready to start!</h1>

	<p>
		Great! You might want to take a quick glance through the rest of the help sections, preferably in order, so that you have a better idea of how to use the site. Studybash is very easy to use, so it shouldn't take you more than 4-5 minutes. Alternatively, if you're the adventurous type, just jump in there and start making flashcards, using the navigation menu at the top of the page! Should you have any questions along the way, please don't hestitate to <a href='<%= ROOT %>#help/contact/' class='navigate'>contact us</a>!
