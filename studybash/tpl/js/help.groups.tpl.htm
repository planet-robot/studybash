	<p>
		When browsing <span class='field-text'>Groups</span>, you are presented with a list that will include:
		<ol>
			<li><span class='field-label'>My Stuff</span>: This group contains only your content - i.e., your flashcards and tests..</li>
			<li><span class='field-label'>Public Studygroup</span>: Every student that added this particular class (i.e., same year/semester) is automatically put into this group. Any flashcards and tests that they created, with a <code>Sharing</code> value of "public", will be accessible through here.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		If you have created, or joined, a private studygroup, you will also see one or more of:
		<ol start="3">
			<li><span class='field-label'>Private Studygroup</span>: Only the students that specifically joined the studygroup will be visible in here. Any flashcards and tests that they created, with a <code>Sharing</code> value of "public" or "studygroup", will be accessible through here.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
