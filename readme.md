Written in 2014 as an SPA using PHP, MySQL, and Javascript (bootstrap, backbone, jquery, underscore).

The website was built around the idea of flashcards (i.e., notes taken in a Q/A format), although it can be used for traditional-style notes as well. Some of the features included:

- Quickly convert pages of notes into flashcards.
- Tag flashcards as "difficult", "follow-up", etc...
- Filter flashcards by tags and/or keywords.
- Create tests based upon filters (e.g., only include cards from "Lecture 3" that are "difficult")
- Share your notes, flashcards, and tests with the whole class or just a private studygroup (or not at all)
- Designed to work on mobile, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

Worked well in 2014. Required some fiddling to get it working again in 2025... web development has changed substantially (for the better!) in the last 10 years :)
